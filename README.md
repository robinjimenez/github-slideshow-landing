# Github user search 
Just a simple plain CSS and JS slider and a Github user search.

To start the server, simply run `node start` and open `localhost:3000` on your favourite browser!

### Known issues and TODOs
- Add form validation
- Blur effect on slider info panel has limited support.
- Improve layout when github data isn't complete
- Slider cursor doesn't follow mouse on scroll.
- Mobile slider nav could have buttons or icons.
